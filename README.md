# wardrobe-AI
Wardrobe AI is a decision-support fashion intelligence system that helps users track their wardrobe, avoid duplicate purchases, and plan outfits smartly. It stores clothing permanently from images, extracts attributes, and recommends outfits or new items based on season, occasion, and variety using AI APIs.

## Database Setup

All database tables are defined in `database/schema.sql`.

To create the schema:
1. Create a PostgreSQL database `wardrobe_ai`
2. Run `schema.sql` in pgAdmin or psql
